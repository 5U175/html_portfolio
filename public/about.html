<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Nearly 15 years of experience in furniture manufacturing industry. Last 7 years produced furniture on CNC machinery. Now I decided that furniture can no longer offer me any new challenges. So I finished Software Tester Course in Software Development Academy.</p>
<p>Recently I attended Web Development course on Udemy. And I am looking forward to get new challenges</p>
